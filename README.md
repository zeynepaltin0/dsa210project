# Dsa210 Project

## Project Overview
In this project , I will analyze suicide rates across countries from 2015 to 2016 and explore how socio-economic factors (e.g., GDP) and happiness indicators (e.g., social support, freedom, corruption) influence these rates. By combining two datasets—Suicide Rates Overview and World Happiness Report— I aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of suicide rates. 

## Motivation
This project will provide valuable insights into the factors influencing suicide rates globally. The findings can be used by policymakers, mental health organizations, and researchers to develop targeted interventions and strategies to reduce suicide rates.

This project can also be hope and a reminder that suicide is caused by many factors and is in fact preventable for people.

## Description of Datasets
I will be using two different datasets for this project:

**1. Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016**  
 Contains suicide rates by country, year, age group, and gender, along with socio-economic data like GDP per capita and HDI.

**3. World Happiness Report**  
    Provides happiness scores and related factors (e.g., social support, freedom, corruption) by country and year.

## Plan
**Data Preparation:**

+ Both datasets will be clean and preprocessed.  
+ Datasets weill be merged through country and year (if necessary).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

+ Visualizing trends in suicide rates over time and across countries.  
+ Exploring correlations between suicide rates and socio-economic/happiness factors.  
+ Analyzing differences in suicide rates by age group and gender.  

**Statistical Analysis And Machine Learning:**
   
+ Statistical models and predictive machine learning methods will be applied.
